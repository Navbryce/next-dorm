# Next Dorm
A social network with hierarchical communities for localized complaining. 
It's a Reddit-clone with option to post anonymously*.
I created it because I always wanted to complain about issues with my dorm in college.
The hall group chat was too niche to complain in, and the subreddit was too broad.
The idea of NextDorm was born.
